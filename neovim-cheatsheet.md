# üìö Neovim Configuration Cheat Sheet

## üéØ Leader Key
Your leader key is set to **SPACE** (`<leader>` = space bar)

### ‚è±Ô∏è Key Sequence Timeout
- **Timeout**: 1000ms (1 second) - Time you have to complete multi-key commands
- **Why it matters**: After pressing `<leader>` (Space), you have 1 second to press the next key
- **Example**: `<leader>pf` = Press Space, then within 1 second press `p`, then `f`
- **Tip**: This prevents accidental pastes when you have text yanked and use Telescope commands

---

## üß≠ Navigation Philosophy
Your Neovim setup uses a **three-tier navigation strategy** for maximum efficiency:

1. **üî≠ Telescope** - For finding files you know exist somewhere in your project
2. **üéØ Harpoon** - For instantly switching between your actively-edited files ‚úÖ
3. **üìÇ File Explorer** - For browsing directory structure when you need to explore

Think of it like this:
- Use **Telescope** when you think "I need to find that config file..."
- Use **Harpoon** when you're bouncing between the same 4-5 files repeatedly
- Use **File Explorer** when you need to see what's in a folder

---

## üî≠ What is Telescope?

**Telescope** is a highly extendable fuzzy finder that revolutionizes how you navigate files and content in Neovim. Unlike traditional file explorers, Telescope lets you find anything by typing partial matches.

### Why Telescope is Powerful:
- **Fuzzy Matching**: Type "useff" to find "useEffect.js" - no need for exact names!
- **Live Preview**: See file contents as you navigate through results
- **Multiple Pickers**: Search files, text content, Git files, buffers, and more
- **Smart Sorting**: Most relevant results appear first
- **Extensible**: Supports many sources beyond just files

### Fuzzy Matching Examples:
- `init` ‚Üí finds `init.lua`, `initialize.js`, `AdminInit.tsx`
- `compo` ‚Üí finds `components/`, `Composer.vue`, `compose.yaml`
- `ueff` ‚Üí finds `useEffect.js`, `userEffects.ts`
- `confts` ‚Üí finds `config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`

## üìÅ File Navigation with Telescope

| Keymap | Description | What It Does |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| `<leader>pf` | **Find Files** | Opens a fuzzy finder to search for files in your project by name. Just start typing! |
| `<leader>ps` | **Live Grep Search** | Search for text content across all files in your project. Great for finding where something is used. |
| `<leader>pg` | **Git Files** | Search only through files tracked by Git (ignores untracked files). |
| `<leader>pb` | **Browse Buffers** | See and switch between all open files (buffers). |
| `<leader>ph` | **Help Tags** | Search through Neovim's help documentation. |
| `<leader>po` | **Recent Files** | Shows your recently opened files for quick access. |
| `<leader>pA` | **Find All Files** | Find files including hidden and ignored ones (like node_modules). |
| `<leader>pv` | **File Explorer** | Opens Neovim's built-in file explorer (netrw) to browse directories. |

### üí° Telescope Tips & Tricks

**Navigation in Telescope:**
- `Ctrl+j/k` or `Ctrl+n/p` - Move up/down through results
- `Enter` - Open the selected file
- `Ctrl+x` - Open file in horizontal split
- `Ctrl+v` - Open file in vertical split
- `Ctrl+t` - Open file in new tab
- `Esc` or `Ctrl+c` - Close Telescope
- `Ctrl+u` - Clear the search prompt
- `Tab` - Toggle selection and move down
- `Shift+Tab` - Toggle selection and move up

**Search Patterns:**
- Start with `^` to match beginning: `^init` finds files starting with "init"
- End with `$` to match ending: `.lua$` finds all Lua files
- Use spaces as wildcards: `user controller` finds "userController.js"
- Case matters only if you use capitals: `User` is case-sensitive, `user` is not

**Pro Tips:**
- In `<leader>ps` (live grep), use regex patterns for complex searches
- Use `<leader>po` (recent files) to quickly return to previous work
- `<leader>pg` (git files) is faster than `<leader>pf` in Git repos
- Combine with Harpoon: Use Telescope to find files, then mark them with Harpoon

## üéØ Harpoon - Quick File Switching

> **Status**: ‚úÖ INSTALLED - Ready to use!

### What is Harpoon?

**Harpoon** is like having speed-dial for your files. Created by ThePrimeagen, it solves the problem of constantly switching between the same 3-5 files during development. Instead of fuzzy finding the same files repeatedly, you "mark" them once and jump between them instantly.

### Why Use Harpoon?

**The Problem It Solves:**
When working on a feature, you often edit the same files repeatedly:
- A component and its test file
- A frontend file and its API endpoint
- Multiple related modules
- Config files you keep checking

**Without Harpoon**: You either spam `<leader>pf` in Telescope, cycle through all buffers with `:bn`, or maintain complex split layouts.

**With Harpoon**: Mark your working files once, then switch between them with single keystrokes. It's muscle memory, not mental overhead.

### Harpoon Keymaps (When Installed)

| Keymap | Description | What It Does |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| `<leader>a` | **Add to Harpoon** | Mark current file for quick access |
| `<leader>h` | **Harpoon Menu** | View/edit your marked files list |
| `<C-h>` | **Go to File 1** | Instantly jump to 1st marked file |
| `<C-t>` | **Go to File 2** | Instantly jump to 2nd marked file |
| `<C-n>` | **Go to File 3** | Instantly jump to 3rd marked file |
| `<C-s>` | **Go to File 4** | Instantly jump to 4th marked file |
| `<leader>1-9` | **Number Navigation** | Jump to marked file by number |

### Harpoon Workflow Example

```
1. Open your main component: components/Button.tsx
2. Mark it: <leader>a
3. Open the test file: Button.test.tsx
4. Mark it: <leader>a
5. Open the styles: Button.module.css
6. Mark it: <leader>a

Now you can instantly jump:
- <C-h> ‚Üí Button.tsx
- <C-t> ‚Üí Button.test.tsx
- <C-n> ‚Üí Button.module.css

No thinking, just muscle memory!
```

### Harpoon vs Telescope vs Buffers

| Tool | Use When | Speed | Mental Load |
|------|----------|-------|-------------|
| **Telescope** | Finding files you haven't opened yet | Medium | High (need to remember names) |
| **Harpoon** | Switching between working set (3-5 files) | Instant | None (muscle memory) |
| **Buffers** (`:bn`) | Cycling through all open files | Slow | Medium (need to cycle) |
| **File Explorer** | Browsing directory structure | Slow | High (need to navigate) |

### Pro Tips for Harpoon
- Mark files at the start of your coding session
- Use consistent positions: File 1 = main code, File 2 = test, etc.
- Marks persist between sessions, so tomorrow you'll start where you left off
- Different projects have different marks - Harpoon is project-aware
- Don't mark more than 5-6 files - defeats the purpose of quick access

## üèãÔ∏è Hardtime - Break Bad Vim Habits

> **Status**: ‚úÖ INSTALLED - Ready to use!

### What is Hardtime?

**Hardtime.nvim** helps you break inefficient Vim habits by temporarily disabling repetitive key presses. It's like a personal trainer for your Vim skills - it prevents you from using inefficient movements and encourages better alternatives.

### Why Use Hardtime?

**Bad Habits It Breaks:**
- Holding `j/k` to navigate (use `{count}j/k` or search instead)
- Repeatedly pressing `h/l` for horizontal movement (use `w/b/e` or `f/t`)
- Using arrow keys instead of `hjkl`
- Inefficient movement patterns

### Hardtime Keymaps

| Keymap | Description | What It Does |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| `<leader>ht` | **Toggle Hardtime** | Enable/disable movement restrictions |
| `<leader>hr` | **Hardtime Report** | Show your usage statistics and bad habits |

### How Hardtime Works

- **Restriction Mode**: Set to "hint" - only shows suggestions without blocking keypresses
- **Hints**: Shows suggestions for better alternatives (e.g., "Use - instead of k^")
- **Smart Detection**: Automatically disabled in UI windows (Telescope, Mason, etc.)
- **Visual Feedback**: Notifications when you hit the restriction limit

### Hardtime Configuration Details

- **Max Count**: 100 repetitions allowed before showing hints (effectively disabled)
- **Max Time**: 1000ms window for counting repetitions
- **Disabled Keys**: Arrow keys are disabled only in normal mode (enabled in insert mode)
- **Restricted Keys**: `h`, `j`, `k`, `l`, and other basic movements
- **Mouse**: Disabled to encourage keyboard navigation

## üëÅÔ∏è Precognition - Learn Available Motions

> **Status**: ‚úÖ INSTALLED - Ready to use!

### What is Precognition?

**Precognition.nvim** shows inline virtual text hints for available motions at your cursor position. It's like having a Vim tutor that constantly shows you what movements are possible, helping you discover and learn efficient navigation patterns.

### Why Use Precognition?

**What It Teaches:**
- Shows available jumps: next word (`w`), end of word (`e`), back (`b`)
- Line movements: beginning (`^`), first character (`0`), end (`$`)
- Matching pairs (`%`) for brackets and parentheses
- Paragraph jumps (`{`, `}`)
- File jumps (`gg`, `G`)

### Precognition Keymaps

| Keymap | Description | What It Does |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| `<leader>pc` | **Toggle Precognition** | Show/hide motion hints |
| `:PrecognitionToggle` | **Command Toggle** | Alternative way to toggle hints |

### Understanding Precognition Hints

**Inline Hints (on current line):**
- `^` - First non-blank character of line
- `0` - Beginning of line
- `w` - Next word
- `e` - End of current/next word
- `b` - Previous word
- `W`, `E`, `B` - WORD movements (space-delimited)
- `$` - End of line
- `%` - Matching bracket/parenthesis

**Gutter Hints (in the sign column):**
- `gg` - Go to first line of file
- `G` - Go to last line of file
- `{` - Previous paragraph/block
- `}` - Next paragraph/block

### How They Work Together

**Learning Workflow:**
1. **Precognition** shows you what movements are available
2. Try using those movements instead of repetitive `hjkl`
3. **Hardtime** blocks you when you fall back to bad habits
4. Over time, you naturally adopt efficient movements

**Example Scenario:**
- You want to move to the end of a line
- Precognition shows `$` hint at the end
- You try pressing `l` repeatedly instead
- Hardtime blocks you after 2 presses and suggests using `$`
- Next time, you remember to use `$` directly!

### Tips for Using Both Plugins

1. **Start with Precognition only** - Learn what's available
2. **Add Hardtime gradually** - Enable it once you know the alternatives
3. **Disable temporarily** - Use `<leader>ht` during urgent work
4. **Check your progress** - Use `<leader>hr` to see improvement
5. **Be patient** - Building muscle memory takes time

### üöÄ Tmux - The Terminal Multiplexer

**Tmux** (terminal multiplexer) is a separate program that manages terminal sessions. Think of it as a "window manager for your terminal."

#### What is Tmux?

Tmux creates persistent terminal sessions that:
- **Survive disconnections** - SSH drops? Your work is still there
- **Run in background** - Close terminal, tmux keeps running
- **Share sessions** - Multiple people can connect to same session
- **Organize workspaces** - Projects in different sessions

#### Why Use Tmux with Neovim?

| Use Case | Without Tmux | With Tmux |
|----------|--------------|-----------|
| **SSH Disconnects** | Lose everything | Reconnect, everything's there |
| **Long Processes** | Must keep terminal open | Detach, let it run, reattach later |
| **Multiple Projects** | Juggle windows/tabs | Switch entire sessions instantly |
| **Remote Pairing** | Screen sharing only | Both developers in same session |
| **System Restart** | Manually reopen everything | Restore entire workspace |

#### Tmux Key Concepts

1. **Sessions** - Entire workspace (like a project)
2. **Windows** - Tabs within a session (like browser tabs)
3. **Panes** - Splits within a window (like Vim splits)

```
Session: "my-project"
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Window 1: "editor" (Neovim)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Window 2: "server" 
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Pane 1: npm run dev
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Pane 2: npm run test:watch
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Window 3: "git" (git commands)
```

#### Essential Tmux Commands

**Outside Tmux:**
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `tmux` | Start new session |
| `tmux new -s project` | New session named "project" |
| `tmux ls` | List all sessions |
| `tmux attach -t project` | Attach to "project" session |
| `tmux kill-session -t project` | Delete "project" session |

**Inside Tmux (prefix = `Ctrl+b` by default):**
| Keymap | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Ctrl+b d` | Detach from session |
| `Ctrl+b c` | Create new window |
| `Ctrl+b n` | Next window |
| `Ctrl+b p` | Previous window |
| `Ctrl+b %` | Split vertically |
| `Ctrl+b "` | Split horizontally |
| `Ctrl+b arrow` | Navigate panes |
| `Ctrl+b z` | Zoom/unzoom pane |
| `Ctrl+b [` | Enter copy mode (vim-like navigation) |

#### Neovim + Tmux Workflow

**Basic Workflow:**
1. `tmux new -s myproject` - Start project session
2. Open Neovim in first window
3. `Ctrl+b c` - New window for server
4. `Ctrl+b c` - New window for git
5. `Ctrl+b 0/1/2` - Switch between windows
6. `Ctrl+b d` - Detach when done
7. `tmux attach -t myproject` - Resume tomorrow

**Advanced Integration:**
- **vim-tmux-navigator** - Seamless Ctrl+hjkl between Vim and tmux panes
- **tmux-resurrect** - Save/restore sessions after restart
- **tmux-continuum** - Auto-save sessions

#### Tmux vs Neovim Terminal

| Feature | Neovim Terminal | Tmux |
|---------|-----------------|------|
| **Persistence** | Dies with Neovim | Survives everything |
| **Remote Work** | Lost on disconnect | Perfect for SSH |
| **Resource Usage** | Part of Neovim | Separate process |
| **Learning Curve** | Just Vim commands | New key bindings |
| **Integration** | Perfect with Neovim | Good with plugins |
| **Use Case** | Quick commands | Long-running sessions |
